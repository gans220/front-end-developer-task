# Rapha Front End Developer Task

Using the assets here, we would like you to use JS/CSS to create something similar _[this fancy hover over the face thing](http://hankjobenhavn.com/#/eyewear/state)_ to show the sunglasses at different angles.

We wouldn’t expect you spend any more than a couple of hours on this.

**NB:** There are additional inline comments within `index.html`.

## Submitting your finished page
You can zip it up and email it to us or fork this and host it on your own GitHub account. We’ll take a look before your interview, but we’ll talk about it with you when you come to meet us too.

## Assets

All the copy is in `index.html`

There are a bunch of images to use within `img/`

You can use grunt to compile your `.scss` or just edit the `.css` file

## Grunt

To use Grunt you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed as well as the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

If you have them already just run `npm install` to get the project setup and then run grunt to get going.
